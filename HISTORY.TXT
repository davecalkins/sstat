sstat revision history
================================================================================
v1.6, 2005-12-10
    - updated contact info, added web page URL, re-released
    - updated default config file

v1.5, 2004-12-02
    - icon re-work to make the icons clearer and to add up/down arrow and
      question mark indicator, providing a second state indicator in addition
      to just color (which supports viewing by someone who can't distinguish
      red/green)
    - found and fixed a handle leak which would cause all servers to show as
      down after running sstat long enough with sufficient server downtime
    - when the main window is minimized, it now gets hidden (doesn't show on
      windows desktop toolbar).  clicking on the tray icon will restore it
    - updated a number of server IPs for the wow config files
